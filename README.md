# Amazon-Shopping-Bot

## Python Libraries Required
1. Selenium
2. Time
3. Schedule

## Aditional Requirements
1. Amazon Email and Password
2. One Shipping Address linked to Amazon account
3. Google Chrome Browser

## Function
This script is set to run every 5 minutes, but you can easily set it to every minute.
Be sure to enter your personal email and password, as well as the url for the product you are wanting. 
Another way to potentially improve this script is to use it for additional internet browsers, since this uses Chrome Driver.
Please use this for good :)
