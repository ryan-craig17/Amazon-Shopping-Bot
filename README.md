# Amazon-Shopping-Bot

## Python Libraries Required
1. Selenium
2. Time
3. Schedule

## Aditional Requirements
1. Amazon Email and Password
2. One Shipping Address linked to Amazon account
3. Google Chrome Browser

## Function
This script is set to run every 5 minutes, so you will want to start as soon as your clock hits either a number ending in 0 or 5 to make sure you hit restock times.
One way this could be improved is to set it to start at every hour and then loop every 5 minutes until completion, but I have not found a way to nest that.
Be sure to enter your personal email and password, as well as the url for the product you are wanting. I used mine to buy PS5's for me and my friends due to scalpers. 
Please use this for good and not evil :)
Another way to potentially improve this script is to use it for additional internet browsers.
